# API Design Challenge

## Purpose

The intended purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your approach to API design. We're interested in seeing how you approach this kind of problem philosophically and pragmatically.

# Problem

You've inherited an API that serves up some model (`rpc1`) to some unspecified clients. We've just come up with a new and improved model (`rpc2`) that serves up slightly different responses. What would you do to introduce the new model to the API? What (if anything) would you have done differently in the initial design to prepare for this event? Please make the code changes necessary to introduce the version, and provide the documentation needed for new and existing consumers to adapt.
