# Python Algorithm Exercise

## Purpose

The goal here is to present you with a silly problem to evaluate algorithm design skills. Consider factors like runtime and maintainability with your solution. Performance counts in this challenge.

## Problem

We are going to create a script to cheat at the game of Countdown. In this game, contestants are presented with 9 semi-random letters, then have 30 seconds to create the longest English word with those letters (used only once each). For your convenience, a wordlist has been included with this challenge. Add any helpers you may need to solve the problem. Provide the necessary implementation in `play_countdown` to pass the tests, along with any documentation necessary to understand your solution.
