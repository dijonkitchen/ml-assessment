# Model Creation Exercise

## Purpose

The goal here is to evaluate your understanding of and comfort level with common machine learning libraries. Your code should make sense, but your model does not need to be production ready. This is intended to be a fairly trival showcase of a common model along with standard data prep and results reporting and/or visualization.

## Problem

You've been provided a csv of challenge data with two columns, `period` and `events`. This data represents consecutive observations. We're interested in forecasting the rate of these events going forward. Please train a model for timeseries forecasting using a standard deep learning library (e.g. tensorflow/keras or torch). Provide the code for training and validation in main.py.
